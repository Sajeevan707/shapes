Consider file “output01a.dat”
where,
initial velocity = 10
angle = 45
dt = 0.01
here the exact landing position is 10.19, and the analytical landing position is 10.25

changing dt = 0.001 the analytical position reduces to 10.20;

For,

initial velocity = 15
angle = 30
here the exact landing position is 19.86, and the analytical landing position is 19.88

changing dt = 0.001 the analytical position remains at 19.88;

it can be seen that reducing the time step brings the analytical value closer to the exact value. Therefore depending on the significant figures 
required the time steps can be lowered. (here time steps >=0.0001 would would make analytical value match the exact to 2 decimal places)

The change in initial conditions does change accuracy of the analytical method which can be clearly seen from the two different inital conditions.

The energy plots should have no overlap between potential and kinetic energies. However, this is not the case for the analytic solution, where there 
is a slight overlap, which can be inferred to the accuracy of the analytical method.
